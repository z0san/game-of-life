# game-of-life

this is a first attempt at a game of life game
the point of this is to first make it normaly before then reproducing it using the gpu to greatly increase performance
a potential final step would be to make the computer run simulations inorder to find "interesting" shpaes or patterns (i'm not sure what you call them)
