# game-of-life

This is a first attempt at a game of life game
The point of this is to first make it normaly before then reproducing it using the gpu to greatly increase performance
a potential final step would be to make the computer run simulations inorder to find "interesting" shpaes or patterns (i'm not sure what you call them)

The current project was programed in processing 3.3.6
